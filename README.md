What'cha Cookin'? App

I was originally making an app to use geolocation and pull from the yelp api resturaunts that there near the user. I could not figure out how to phrase the call correctly and so I went with the next best thing, a souped up version of my favortite app "What the Fuck Should I make for Dinner".

This application queries the Yummy API and pulls information based on user input

[bug!] There is a bug where you have to use all lowercase when typing into the cuisine field

[bug!] I broke the course somehow and don't remeber what I did to make it work with the cuisine
